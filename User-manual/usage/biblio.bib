@article{Guignard:2020aa,
	abstract = {Ascidians, or sea squirts, are marine invertebrate filter feeders with highly reproducible cellular events and invariant embryonic cell lineages. Guignard et al. studied the ascidian embryo to address the determinants of this cellular reproducibility. They introduce computational methods for the robust and automated segmentation, tracking, and analysis of whole-cell behaviors in high-throughput light-sheet microscopy datasets. This work shows that cell induction can be controlled by the contact area among cells. The range of cell signaling is proposed to set the scale at which animal embryonic reproducibility is observed. A high level of reproducibility of embryonic geometries may also counter-intuitively lift constraints on genome evolution, thereby contributing to the rapid molecular evolution observed in ascidians. Science, this issue p. eaar5663 A combination of advanced imaging and computational modeling reveals that a limited range of cell signaling constrains sea squirt development. Marine invertebrate ascidians display embryonic reproducibility: Their early embryonic cell lineages are considered invariant and are conserved between distantly related species, despite rapid genomic divergence. Here, we address the drivers of this reproducibility. We used light-sheet imaging and automated cell segmentation and tracking procedures to systematically quantify the behavior of individual cells every 2 minutes during Phallusia mammillata embryogenesis. Interindividual reproducibility was observed down to the area of individual cell contacts. We found tight links between the reproducibility of embryonic geometries and asymmetric cell divisions, controlled by differential sister cell inductions. We combined modeling and experimental manipulations to show that the area of contact between signaling and responding cells is a key determinant of cell communication. Our work establishes the geometric control of embryonic inductions as an alternative to classical morphogen gradients and suggests that the range of cell signaling sets the scale at which embryonic reproducibility is observed.},

	abstract = {Local regression is an old method for smoothing data, having origins in the graduation of mortality data and the smoothing of time series in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. Still, new work in local regression continues at a rapid pace. We review the history of local regression. We discuss four of its basic components that must be chosen in using local regression in practice --- the weight function, the parametric family that is fitted locally, the bandwidth, and the assumptions about the distribution of the response. A major theme of the paper is that these choices represent a modeling of the data; different data sets deserve different choices. We describe polynomial mixing, a method for enlarging polynomial parametric families. We introduce an approach to adaptive fitting,assessment of parametric localization. We describe the use of this approach to design two adaptive procedures: one automatically chooses the mixing degree of mixing polynomials at each x using cross-validation, and the other chooses the bandwidth at each x using C                              p              . Finally, we comment on the efficacy of using asymptotics to provide guidance for methods of local regression.},

@inproceedings{Guignard:2014aa,
	abstract = {{Current imaging techniques can capture temporal sequences of 3D images with very high time resolution over several hours. Com- paring sequences covering the same time period opens the way to the study of developmental variability. Stitching together sequences captured from different embryos may help producing a sequence covering the whole development of the animal of interest. For this, it is necessary to align two sequences in both time and space. We present here a method to align two 3D+t time series, based on the detection and pairing of 3D+t landmarks. These landmarks, which correspond to periods of fast morphogenetic change, are de- duced from the analysis of the non-linear transformations that allow to co-register pairs of consecutive 3D images in each sequence.}},
