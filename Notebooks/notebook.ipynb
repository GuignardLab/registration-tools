    "-Either you have a timesequence of z-stacks, with only one channel (3D+time data), then you can give as an input the path to the timesequence.<br>\n",
    "-Either you give direclty a hyperstack as the input (a 3D movie with one or multiple channel). In that case, give as an input the folder where the hyperstack is saved. Every movie of the folder will be registered separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part prepares the data, cut the movie into a timesequence if you gave an hyperstack, and asks for the parameters. The second part does the actual registration. The third part saves the registered sequence as a stack, and the fourth part saves the parameter files.\n",
    "The process can take few minutes depending on the size of your data. If there is an error, it will be printed either below or in the terminal window. To solve it, please consider the 'Troubleshooting' section."
